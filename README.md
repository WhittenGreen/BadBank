# BadBank
 Banking Application - Using MongoDB, Express, React, aand Node.js. This is the final assignment for completion of my certification in Full stack web development. This is a good show of both front end and back end, routing, apis, databases, etc. 

 To install:
 Git clone the propject, npm init once you have downloaded the files, walk through the init. Install all dependencies using npm (express, cors, mongodb).

 I would like to add many new features for this app and really make this more than interaction within cards. I will be sure to add more and more as I get better and more experienced in coding.
